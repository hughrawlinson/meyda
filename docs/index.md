## What is Meyda?
Meyda is a JavaScript audio feature extraction library. It works with the Web Audio API (or plain old JavaScript arrays) to expose information about the timbre and perceived qualities of sound. Meyda supports both offline feature extraction as well as real-time feature extraction using the [Web Audio API][webaudioapi]. We wrote a paper about it, which is available [here][paper].
