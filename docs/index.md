## What is Meyda?

Meyda is a JavaScript audio feature extraction library. It works with the Web
Audio API (or plain old JavaScript arrays) to expose information about the
timbre and perceived qualities of sound. Meyda supports both offline feature
extraction as well as real-time feature extraction using the
[Web Audio API][webaudioapi]. We wrote a paper about it, which is available
[here][paper].

Would you like your Meyda project to be featured in our [user showcase]? [Please let us know!](https://github.com/meyda/meyda/issues/new?assignees=&labels=Showcase+Request&template=showcase-application.md&title=)
